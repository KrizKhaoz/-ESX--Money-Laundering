I worked a few hours today on making this money laundering script its not 100% perfect but it gets the job done if you have used the "esx_gopostal" script then it pretty much is that script just a few things added and a few things removed, so full credits to the creator of that. 

**Credits:**
ORIGINAL SCRIPT BY Marcio FOR CFX-ESX
Modified By: Kriz Frost

**How It Works**
in the script you can specify what job they need to have to be able to use this "job" for money laundering I have it set to "unemployed" you can find that in the files I have added comments to it as well once you have the job specified you go to the casino choose "workwear" then walk into the markers and you can begin delivering You can deliver as many as you want but you need to return your truck to get the payout if you do not return the vehicle you will not get paid.

**How to Install**
Simply just place the folder in your resources and add 
start esx_goDirty
to your server.cfg

**Requirements:**
ESX
